## Validate Email Address to RFC2821 and RFC2822


</div>

### Description

Having failed to find anything similar, this function validates an email address. It takes into consideration the RFC2821 and RFC2822 rules and also the the limitations imposed by other systems in the real world, that often conflict with RFC's.
 
### More Info
 
Any email address requiring format validation

This was written because I failed to find any similar validator that was not flawed in some serious way, even for general use. Any PSC user is welcome to use, improve, speed up, remove unwanted features, and/or modify the code as they wish for their own purposes.

Returns True of False, and has an option that allows the user to intercept and decide on the validity of a questionable emai address at run time.

If used in the extended 'allow ALL legal RFC characters, then 'Quoted text' is not checked.
